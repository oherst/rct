### Getting started:
* Setup project with `npm install`
* Run local dev server with `npm start`
* Run tests with `npm test`
* Generate production build with `npm run build` (output will be saved to `dist/`)

### Tested on the following devices/browsers:
* macOS X - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera
* Windows 10 - Edge, IE11, IE10
* Android - Chrome

### Notes:
Two alternative stylesheets are available for formations '442' and
'3421' to exactly match the provided grid layouts as I wasn't sure of the grid dimensions.
(These can be enabled in app.scss).
